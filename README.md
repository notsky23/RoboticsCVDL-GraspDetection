# RoboticsCV-PointCloudAnalysis

HW Guide: https://github.com/notsky23/RoboticsCV-PointCloudAnalysis/blob/master/hw4-v2.pdf.<br><br>

## What is this practice about?<br>

This module is a cross between computer vision and robotics. We will be using point clouds to help a robot analyze and make sense of it's surroundings.<br><br>

In this module, we will be applying 2 algorithms to point clouds:<br>
1. Random sample consensus (RANSAC)<br>
2. Iterative closest point (ICP)<br><br>

## Installation Instructions:

We recommend using Anaconda to set up your virtual environment, but you can use whatever method you wish.
Execute the following commands to set up the environment with conda: 
```

conda create -n hw6 python=3.8
conda activate hw6
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here are the results I got.<br>

The code is included in this repo.<br><br>
